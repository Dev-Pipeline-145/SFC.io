## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas

1. **Feature Parity** - Risk of losing features during migration
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive feature audit (Phase 1) will help prevent this
   - **Status**: Feature audit complete, but documentation incomplete

2. **SEO Impact** - Risk of SEO degradation during migration
   - **Mitigation**: Current SEO is well-implemented, preserve all elements
   - **Status**: SEO elements identified and ready to migrate

3. **Design Differences** - Risk of visual differences after migration
   - **Mitigation**: Complete design system documentation
   - **Status**: CSS variables exist but not fully documented

### Medium Risk Areas

1. **Performance** - Risk of performance degradation
   - **Mitigation**: Current site has good performance optimizations
   - **Status**: Performance patterns identified

2. **Content Loss** - Risk of missing content during migration
   - **Mitigation**: Complete content inventory
   - **Status**: Content inventory incomplete

---

## Conclusion

The current static site is **feature-complete and well-implemented** with excellent SEO, PWA support, and interactive functionality. However, the **Next.js/TypeScript migration has not begun**, and **Phase 1 documentation is incomplete**.

**Key Takeaways**:
- ✅ Current site is production-ready and well-architected
- ⚠️ Phase 1 documentation needs completion
- ❌ Phase 2 migration needs to begin immediately
- 📋 Strong foundation exists for successful migration

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Complete Phase 1 documentation (design system, content inventory)
2. Create Next.js project structure
3. Begin homepage migration as proof of concept
4. Migrate page-by-page with QA checkpoints
